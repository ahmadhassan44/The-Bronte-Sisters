The story begins with Jane’s difficult childhood at Gateshead Hall, where she lives with her wealthy but cruel aunt, Mrs. Reed. Constantly mistreated and isolated, Jane eventually stands up for herself, which leads to her being sent away to Lowood Institution, a strict boarding school for orphaned girls. At Lowood, Jane endures harsh conditions and the loss of her dear friend, Helen Burns, but over time, she matures into a disciplined and well-educated young woman.</p>

                <p>As an adult, Jane leaves Lowood to become a governess at Thornfield Hall, where she meets the brooding and mysterious master of the house, Mr. Rochester. Despite their differences in social status, Jane and Rochester develop a deep emotional connection, and he eventually proposes to her. However, on their wedding day, Jane discovers that Rochester is already married to a mentally ill woman, Bertha Mason, who is secretly confined in the attic of Thornfield. Devastated by the revelation, Jane refuses to become his mistress and chooses to leave, valuing her principles and self-respect over her love for him.</p>

                <p>Wandering alone, Jane nearly perishes from starvation before being taken in by the Rivers family. She soon learns that they are her long-lost relatives and that she has inherited a fortune from an uncle. St. John Rivers, her cousin and a clergyman, proposes marriage, urging her to accompany him on a missionary trip to India. Though she admires his dedication, Jane refuses because she does not love him. One night, she mysteriously hears Rochester’s voice calling to her, prompting her to return to Thornfield. She finds the estate in ruins, as Bertha Mason had set it on fire before perishing in the flames. Rochester, now blind and disabled from the fire, lives in seclusion. Moved by love and forgiveness, Jane reunites with him, and they marry, finally finding happiness and equality in their relationship.</p>

                <p>The novel explores themes of morality, love, independence, and social class, making Jane Eyre one of the most celebrated works of English literature.
